    "This Python code snippet, which uses the **Pydantic** library, defines a data model for loading machine learning models. Let's break down what each part means:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `class ModelLoader(BaseModel):`\n",
    "\n",
    "* This line defines a class named `ModelLoader` that inherits from `BaseModel`.\n",
    "* **`BaseModel`** is a class provided by Pydantic. By inheriting from it, `ModelLoader` gets powerful data validation and parsing capabilities. It ensures that data passed to `ModelLoader` instances conforms to the types you've defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `model_provider: Literal[\"groq\", \"openai\"] = \"groq\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "* This line defines a class attribute named `model_provider`.\n",
    "* **`Literal[\"groq\", \"openai\"]`** is a type hint from the `typing` module. It means that the `model_provider` field can **only** be one of the two string values: `\"groq\"` or `\"openai\"`. This is a strict form of validation. If you try to set `model_provider` to anything else, like `\"cohere\"`, Pydantic will raise a validation error.\n",
    "* **`= \"groq\"`** sets a default value for the field. If a `ModelLoader` object is created without specifying `model_provider`, its value will be `\"groq\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `config: Optional[ConfigLoader] = Field(default=None, exclude=True)`\n",
    "\n",
    "* This line defines a field named `config`.\n",
    "* **`Optional[ConfigLoader]`** means that the value of `config` can be either an instance of the `ConfigLoader` class or `None`.\n",
    "* **`Field(...)`** is a Pydantic function used to provide extra configuration for a field.\n",
    "* **`default=None`** explicitly sets the default value of the field to `None`.\n",
    "* **`exclude=True`** is a key Pydantic setting. It means that when you export the `ModelLoader` object to a dictionary or JSON using methods like `.model_dump()` or `.model_dump_json()`, the `config` field will be **excluded** from the output. This is useful for internal-only data that shouldn't be serialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `def model_post_init(self, __context: Any) -> None:`\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a special Pydantic method that runs **after** the model has been initialized and validated.\n",
    "* The `__context` parameter is a Pydantic-specific detail and can be ignored for general understanding.\n",
    "* **`self.config = ConfigLoader()`** is the main action here. It creates an instance of the `ConfigLoader` class and assigns it to the `config` field. This ensures that the `config` is always set up, but it happens *after* the initial validation of the object's creation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `class Config:`\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is an inner class used to configure the behavior of the parent `ModelLoader` model.\n",
    "* **`arbitrary_types_allowed = True`** is the setting you asked about. By default, Pydantic only allows a certain set of types (like strings, numbers, and other Pydantic models) to be used as field types. When you set this to `True`, you are telling Pydantic that it's okay to have fields with custom, non-Pydantic types, such as the `ConfigLoader` class in this example. Without this line, Pydantic would raise an error because it wouldn't know how to validate or serialize a `ConfigLoader` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this code creates a `ModelLoader` class that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Can handle either \"groq\" or \"openai\" as a model provider.\n",
    "2.  Initializes a `ConfigLoader` object for its internal use.\n",
    "3.  Ensures that this internal `config` object is not included when the `ModelLoader` instance is exported to data formats like JSON.\n",

    "The code snippet `def __call__(self): return self.build_graph()` defines a special method in Python. It means that an instance of the class can be called like a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of `__call__`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__call__` method is a built-in feature of Python classes. When you define this method, you make an object of that class **callable**. This means you can use parentheses `()` after the object's name, just as if it were a function.\n",

    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",

    "my_object = MyClass()\n",
    "# Call the object like a function\n",
    "my_object()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code `def __call__(self): return self.build_graph()`, the `__call__` method simply executes another method of the class, `self.build_graph()`, and returns its result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What It Means for Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This design pattern is often used to simplify the interface of an object. Instead of having to explicitly call a method like `my_loader.build_graph()`, a user can just write `my_loader()`. This can make the code cleaner and more intuitive, especially for objects that are designed to perform a primary action, such as building a graph or processing data.\n",
